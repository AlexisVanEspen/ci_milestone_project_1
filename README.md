# Code Institute's Full Stack Web Developer - Milestone Project 1: Build a Static Website.
(Repository on GitHub: ci_milestone_project_1).
Author: Alexis Van Espen.

# Introduction
The project is about Esperanto.
In a nutshell, Esperanto is a language constructed in the 19th century. Because of its artificial nature, it's often disregarded as "not a real language", "not suited for real communication"... Hence, "not worth learning". Nothing could be farther from the truth.
The project is to build a simple website to briefly introduce what esperanto is, and why and how to learn it.
I will have achieved my goal is some members of the jury desire to know more about Esperanto.

# Main goals (the problem)
Here is an outline of the project's high level goals. This is "the problem", what we need to solve.
1. Make Esperanto better known.
2. Dismiss common myths about this language.
3. Bring more people to consider learning Esperanto.
4. Demonstrate my knowledge and my commitment in this field.
5. Connect to other language lovers around the world, possibly opening opportunities for collaboration as a developer.

# Target audience
Who are the intended visitors of this website?
The site targets people interested in lifelong learning, specifically language learning. Based on my own experience, the age typically ranges from 25 to 65 years old. They spend a lot of time on the web, consuming online courses on learning platforms. Generally, this audience is open to change and tends to see the silver lining on the cloud. 
The audience may be divided in two broad groups:
1. _People who do not know about Esperanto._ I want to give them a flavour of the language.
2. _People Who already know about Esperanto._ I may want to connect with them, possibly as a developer.

# Features (a possible solution)
The problem can be solved through the implementation of features. They constitute "a possible solution" to the problem.
Arguably, the problem _could_ be solved with a movie, a play, a book... These solutions should be kept in mind. For this project, however, I obviously want to build a website. This makes perfect sense: as we said, the target audience spends a lot of time on the web.
Given the solution is to take the shape of a website, which features could we include in it?
